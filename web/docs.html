<h3 id="what">1. What's mnm ?</h3>

<p>mnm provides the benefits of email without the huge risks of allowing 
anyone, anywhere, claiming any identity to send you any content, any number of times. 
</p>

<p>mnm also offers electronic correspondence features missing from traditional email, 
including forms/surveys which may be filled out and returned, 
charts via [Chart.js or Vega-Lite], hyperlinks to messages, and slide shows. 
It creates HTML-formatted messages via Markdown, which enables 
mouseless (i.e. rapid) composition of rich text with graphical elements. 
</p>

<p>mnm is a client application that securely connects to 
any number of TMTP relay services via separate accounts. 
TMTP service accounts control who can send them correspondence. 
Organizations of any size can run TMTP services on public or private network sites, 
and may limit who participates in them. 
See also <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/networkimprov/mnm/blob/master/Rationale.md"
>Why TMTP?</a> 
</p>

<p>This version of mnm is a localhost web app (i.e. it runs on personal devices and its UI runs 
in a browser). 
The source is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/networkimprov/mnm-hammer">on GitHub</a>. 
</p>

<p>mnm stands for <i>Mnm is Not Mail</i></p>


<h4 id="cryp">1a. Encryption</h4>

<p>mnm employs TLS (aka SSL) to secure connections between the client and each server it connects to. 
mnm does not offer end-to-end encryption (where clients en/decrypt messages before/after transmission). 
</p>

<p>The author encourages corporations that transmit highly sensitive information 
via electronic messaging to propose enhancements to the mnm software for their needs. 
</p>

<p>For individuals who desire end-to-end email encryption, 
the author recommends any of the secure, audited electronic mail offerings on the market. 
</p>


<h3 id="look">2. Look &amp; Feel</h3>

<p><b>Warning!</b> 
Confirmation dialogs for send, etc. are [not yet implemented]. 
Undo for edit, delete, etc. are [not yet implemented]. 
</p>

<p><b>Browser Tabs</b>.
Each TMTP account viewed appears in a separate browser tab. 
Tabs may be closed and re-opened without impacting the client's connection to the service, 
as the client runs outside the browser. 
</p>

<p><b>Panels</b>.
mnm divides its screen into three panels. 
The message panel is on the left, 
so its left margin (the most-seen region for left-to-right languages) is free from distractions, 
helping the reader/writer to concentrate. 
The accounts panel is on the right, 
so its frequent activity notifications are far from the normal focus of the user. 
The thread index panel is between them.
</p>

<p><b>Colors</b>.
The color scheme is intended to reduce the glare of black-on-white
designs, and foster concentration. 
The accounts panel is dark, to de-emphasize its constant updates. 
Received and sent messages appear on a background reminiscent 
of parchment, to imply a sense of permanence. 
Menu backgrounds are ... [not yet implemented]. 
Input fields have a white background for emphasis.
</p>

<p><b>Controls</b>.
Dropdown menus <span uk-icon="bell"></span> 
are indicated by a simple drawing (icon) without a border. 
Hyperlinks <a onclick="return false"><span uk-icon="mail"></span></a> 
which open a browser tab or alter a view appear as text or an icon in blue. 
(Note that mnm does not touch the browser history.) 
Option tabs [tab here] 
which alter a view have a title in all-caps [will change] 
and show a blue underscore on the current tab, plus &times; if it's closable. 
Buttons <button onclick="return false" class="btn-icon"
        title="Description of action"><span uk-icon="forward"></span></button> 
which change the state of the system appear as an icon on a 
button background, and display help text when the mouse hovers on them. 
Popup menus <span class="draftmenu-sample draftmenu">etc &#x25BD;</span> 
which carry variable contents show &#x25BD; when they contain multiple items. 
<i>To</i> and <i>Group</i> input fields pop up a keyboard-navigable menu 
<span class="adrsbkmenu" style="display:inline-block"><span class="adrsbkmenu-select">etc</span></span> 
of aliases or groups matching the input text. 
</p>

<p>An mnm client optimized for small screens is ... 
[not yet implemented].
</p>


<h3 id="acct">3. Accounts</h3>

<p>The right-hand panel lists the user's accounts on TMTP services. 
The account represented in the current browser tab has a <span uk-icon="settings"></span> menu 
which gives its configuration. 
Other accounts have a <span uk-icon="bell"></span> menu that summarizes recent activity 
therein [not yet implemented]. 
</p>

<p>To create an account on a TMTP service, 
use the form in the <span uk-icon="plus-circle"></span> menu. 
The form needs 
the <i>Title</i> to display in the accounts panel (e.g. the name of the service), 
a personal or professional name (the <i>Alias</i>), and 
the <i>Net Address</i> where the server is running (e.g. somebiz.net:443). 
<!--todo Connections to the service are periodic if <i>(Pd days:hh:mm:ss)</i> is set. -->
If the service's TLS certificate is not registered with a certificate authority 
(e.g. it's a testing server) uncheck <i>Verify identity</i>. 
These settings can be amended later [partially implemented]. 
</p>

<p>The service may require member-specific credentials (e.g. for Radius or LDAP). 
[not yet implemented]
</p>

<p>The account's user ID (UID) and password are randomly generated by the service and stored on 
the client device. Both are equally unguessable. 
The UID is revealed to other service members only by delivery of or reply to an invite. 
</p>

<p>To change the <i>Net Address</i> <!--todo i>(Pd days:hh:mm:ss),</i --> or <i>Verify identity</i> settings, 
use the form in the <span uk-icon="settings"></span> menu on the accounts panel. 
New settings take effect immediately if there is no connection to the service 
(e.g. if the current address is invalid), otherwise they take effect when the mnm client is restarted. 
</p>


<h4 id="alis">3a. Aliases</h4>

<p>Aliases are the names by which service members know each other. 
An alias conveyed verbally or by phone is used in an invite to make initial contact 
with another service member. 
Users may create additional aliases after joining a service, corresponding to different roles, etc. 
</p>

<p>To add an alias, open the <span uk-icon="settings"></span> menu on the accounts panel, 
and use the <i>+Alias</i> form. 
[not yet implemented on client]
</p>

<p>Aliases cannot be transferred to a different UID (and therefore cannot be removed), 
but may be deactivated and reactivated.
[not yet implemented]
</p>


<h4 id="node">3b. Nodes</h4>

<p>A user may replicate an account on other devices running the mnm client. 
Each copy of an account is referred to as a node, and has a unique, server-generated password. 
All nodes receieve every message sent to the account. 
Nodes provide automatic backup of account data, and access to it from any device running mnm. 
</p>

<p>To add a node, open the <span uk-icon="settings"></span> menu on the accounts panel, 
and use the <i>+Node</i> form. 
The client creating the node must contact an existing node to download the data for the account. 
[not yet implemented on client]
</p>

<p>To deactivate a node, open the <span uk-icon="settings"></span> menu on the accounts panel, 
and ... 
[not yet implemented]
</p>


<h3 id="invt">4. Invitations</h3>

<p>A service member makes initial contact with another member by sending an invite (a.k.a. ping). 
Invites include the sender's UID &amp; alias, the recipient's alias, 
an optional group name (GID), and an optional short, plain-text message. 
The sender is not notified if the recipient's alias is deactivated. 
</p>

<p>Receipt of an invite adds the sender's UID &amp; alias to the recipient's address book. 
The recipient may respond by sending an invite themselves, by starting a thread 
with the sender, or by joining the group if one is included. 
Issuing a response is optional. 
</p>

<p>Received invites are logged in the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu under the <i>Invites</i> tab. 
Sent invites are logged under the <i>Sent</i> tab. 
Items in these tabs for which responses have been sent or received indicate the date of the response 
and its type: 
<span uk-icon="rss"></span> for an invite, 
<span uk-icon="check"></span> for an accepted group invitation, 
<span uk-icon="plus-circle"></span> if the recipient joined the group, and a 
<span uk-icon="mail"></span> hyperlink for a thread. 
</p>

<p>To compose an invite, open the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu, 
select the <i>Drafts</i> tab, and fill in the <span uk-icon="pencil"></span> form. 
This adds a draft to the list below the form. 
Add a <i>Message</i> to the draft as necessary; its text is automatically saved. 
A draft's <i>To</i> and <i>(Group)</i> fields cannot be updated; to change them 
delete the draft and create another. 
</p>

<p>To send an invite, click its <span uk-icon="forward"></span> button. 
If it cannot be sent immediately, it is queued, which is indicated 
by the <span uk-icon="bolt"></span> icon on the draft. 
</p>

<p>To delete a draft unsent, click its <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button. 
</p>

<p>After receiving an invite or a thread started in response to a sent invite, the recipient 
may block further communication from the sender. 
The sender is not notified that the recipient blocked them. 
[not yet implemented]
</p>


<h3 id="grup">5. Groups</h3>

<p>A group provides an alias to a set of service members. 
As currently designed, 
this feature is suitable for communities of friends or colleagues who trust each other, 
not for public discussions to which any service member can subscribe. 
One joins a group by accepting an invite from a current group participant. 
Existing participants receive a notification when someone joins, leaves, 
updates their group membership info, or issues an invite. 
A message delivered via a group does not list the participants who received it. 
Group membership lists are stored on the TMTP server. 
</p>

<p>Groups which the user has joined or created are listed in the <span uk-icon="users"></span> 
menu under the <i>Groups</i> tab. 
Those created by the user are marked with <span class="uk-badge">A</span>. 
Received and sent invitations are logged in the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu 
under the <i>Invites</i> and <i>Sent</i> tabs.
</p>

<p>To create a group, compose an invite (see <a href="#invt">Invitations</a>) with a new group name. 
To invite someone to join an existing group, compose an invite with that group name. 
The <i>Search Groups</i> text box presents a menu of known groups. 
To copy a group selected via <i>Search Groups</i> into the <i>(Group)</i> text box, 
press enter while the <i>Search Groups</i> box has the edit cursor. 
Then optionally write a <i>Message</i> and send the invite. 
</p>

<p>To join a group in response to an invite, open the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu, 
select the <i>Invites</i> tab, and click the <span uk-icon="forward"></span> button 
next to the group name. 
If the acceptance cannot be sent immediately, it is queued, which is indicated
by the <span uk-icon="bolt"></span> icon on the invite. 
</p>

<p>To list a group's membership, any current participant may... 
[not yet implemented]
</p>

<p>To change one's group membership info, any current participant may... 
[not yet implemented on client]
</p>

<p>To drop oneself or another group participant from the group, any current participant may... 
[not yet implemented on client]
</p>


<h3 id="ohis">6. Ohis</h3>

<p>A service member may designate contacts to be notified when dis/connecting from/to the service. 
This presence notification is referred to as an ohi. 
Service members automatically receive ohis from any contacts who have so designated them. 
Ohis do not carry a message. 
</p>

<p>The list of online contacts who have chosen to notify you appears 
in a floating panel with dark background at the bottom-right corner of the threads panel. 
To hide or show the floating panel, click the o/ icon next to the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu. 
</p>

<p>To add a contact to receive ohis from you, open the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu, 
select the <i>Ohi To</i> tab, use the <i>To</i> field to select an alias, press enter, 
then click the o/ button. 
</p>

<p>To drop a contact receiving ohis from you, open the <span uk-icon="users"></span> menu,
select the <i>Ohi To</i> tab, and click the <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button for that contact. 
</p>

<p>Ohis are not delivered to a recipient who has blocked the sender. 
</p>


<h3 id="upld">7. Attachable Files</h3>

<p>Files to be attached to outgoing messages are first added to the 
<span uk-icon="push"></span> menu. 
A file may be safely removed from the menu after it's been attached, 
but leaving it there doesn't consume any storage space. 
</p>

<p>To upload a file, open the <span uk-icon="push"></span> menu, click the <i>Browse</i> button and 
select a file, amend the upload name as necessary, and click the <span uk-icon="push"></span> button. 
</p>

<p>To copy a file attachment from the most-recently selected thread to the 
<span uk-icon="push"></span> menu, open the <span uk-icon="location"></span> menu 
and click the attachment's <span uk-icon="push"></span> button. 
[not yet implemented]
</p>

<p>The list of files may be sorted using the <i>Date</i> and <i>Name</i> tabs. 
</p>

<p>To open or download a file, click its filename or <span uk-icon="download"></span> hyperlink. 
</p>

<p>To delete a file, click its <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button. 
</p>


<h3 id="form">8. Blank Forms</h3>

<p>Users may create forms/surveys, similar to those on web pages, 
to request specific data from their correspondents. 
Blank forms are shared as attachments. 
Filled-form results are returned as attachments, 
and automatically appended to <a href="#fftb">Filled-Form Tables</a>. 
</p>

<p>Blank forms are grouped into families. 
All forms in a family produce results containing the same set of fields (i.e. data type). 
Form names have the format family_name.revision_name. 
Each revision defines a variation of the form (e.g. for use with different audiences). 
A family with more than one revision must also have a family_name.spec object. 
A .spec object defines the data type produced by the family, and is used to validate 
filled-form results. 
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">The .spec object may contain a data type specification, 
or a filled-form name (FFN) that points into an online repository of specifications. 
[FFN lookup not yet implemented]
A data type specification is a JSON object with an array of field definitions. 
Each definition has <tt>name</tt>, <tt>status</tt>, and <tt>type</tt> members. 
An array definition also has an <tt>array</tt> member indicating the number of dimensions. 
Type <tt>object</tt> fields have a nested <tt>spec</tt> list. 
This example illustrates all the options: 
</p>

<pre style="background-color:inherit; border:none; margin:0">{"spec":[
  {"name":"nr", "status":"required",   "type":"number" },
  {"name":"so", "status":"optional",   "type":"string" },
  {"name":"bd", "status":"deprecated", "type":"bool"   },
  {"name":"or", "status":"required",   "type":"object", "spec":[
    {"name":"anr", "status":"required", "type":"number", "array":2},
    {"name":"aso", "status":"optional", "type":"string", "array":1}
  ]}
]}
</pre>

<p style="margin-bottom:0">This version of mnm embeds the 
Vue Form Generator to render blank forms and produce results from user input. 
See the <a target="_blank" href="https://icebob.gitbooks.io/vueformgenerator/content/schema.html"
>VFG docs</a> covering form definition objects. 
This example definition conforms to the above spec: 
</p>

<pre style="background-color:inherit; border:none; margin:0">{"fields":[
  {"label":"SO", "model":"so", "type":"input", "inputType":"text"},
  {"label":"NR", "model":"nr", "type":"input", "inputType":"number"},
  {"label":"ASR", "model":"or.asr", "type":"checklist",
   "listBox":true, "values":["a","b"]},
  {"label":"ANO", "model":"or.ano", "type":"checklist",
   "inputType":"array",
   "listBox":true, "values":[{"name":"aa", "value":[1,2]},
                             {"name":"bb", "value":[2,2]}] }
]}
</pre>

<p>Blank form field names, given by <tt>name</tt> variables in a .spec object, 
and <tt>model</tt> variables in a form definition, may not begin with <tt>$</tt>, 
as mnm uses that symbol internally. 
</p>

<p>To create a blank form, open the <span uk-icon="file-edit"></span> menu and
enter a family name and optional revision name (separated by ".") 
in the <span uk-icon="pencil"></span> form. 
</p>

<p>To edit a new or existing form, open the <span uk-icon="file-edit"></span> menu 
and click its <span uk-icon="triangle-left"></span>formname hyperlink to open the form editor. 
Next click the <tt>{...}</tt> hyperlink to switch to code view, and begin editing. 
Click <tt>{...}</tt> again to preview changes. 
Edits are automatically saved, except when the code is not valid JSON. 
Closing the editor or switching to a different form drops the latest invalid changes, if any. 
</p>

<p>To copy an existing form to a new revision, open the form editor for the source form 
and enter a revision name (without the family name) 
in the <span uk-icon="copy"></span> form at the bottom of the editor panel. 
</p>

<p>To copy a blank form attachment from the most-recently selected thread to the 
<span uk-icon="file-edit"></span> menu, open the <span uk-icon="location"></span> menu 
and click the attachment's <span uk-icon="file-edit"></span> button. 
[not yet implemented]
</p>

<p>The list of forms may be sorted using the <i>Date</i> and <i>Name</i> tabs. 
Families remain grouped when sorted by date. 
</p>

<p>To delete a form, click its <span uk-icon="trash"></span> button. 
</p>


<h3 id="thrd">9. Threads</h3>

<p>The middle panel presents the service's logo (if available) [not yet implemented] 
and the account title, followed by a listing from the thread index controlled by 
the tabs above the list. 
<i>All</i> lists all threads. 
<i>Unread</i> lists threads with messages that have not been opened [not yet implemented]. 
<i>Todo</i> lists threads with messages flagged as todo items [not yet implemented]. 
<i>FFT</i> lists filled-form tables. 
The search box creates a tab listing threads that match the query. 
[thread indexing &amp; search not yet implemented]
</p>

<p>To sort the thread list by the date of the first message in each thread, click ... 
[not yet implemented]. 
To sort the thread list by the date of the most recent message in each thread, click ... 
[not yet implemented].
</p>

<p>To display a thread in the left-hand panel, click its line in the list. 
This adds the thread to the set of recently selected threads (history). 
</p>

<p>To navigate the thread history, 
use the <span uk-icon="arrow-left"></span><span uk-icon="arrow-right"></span> hyperlinks. 
</p>

<p>To start a new thread, click the <span uk-icon="pencil"></span> button. 
</p>


<h4 id="fftb">9a. Filled-Form Tables</h4>

<p>Both incoming and outgoing filled-form results are appended to filled-form tables, 
which are listed under the <i>FFT</i> tab. 
See also <a href="#form">Blank Forms</a>. 
</p>

<p>To view a filled-form table in a thread panel tab, click its line in the <i>FFT</i> list. 
</p>

<p>To view the thread &amp; message that created a filled-form table entry, click its 
<span uk-icon="mail"></span> hyperlink. 
</p>

<p>Future versions of mnm will provide filled-form table queries, 
and operations on query results. 
</p>


<h3 id="msgs">10. Messages</h3>

<p>The left-hand panel presents the subject and message list for the most-recently selected thread. 
If the thread has multiple subjects, the subject field becomes a menu (denoted by &#x25BD;) 
headed by the subject of the most recent message. 
</p>

<p>The message list shows a header for every message in the thread. 
The tabs above the list control which messages are open (i.e. fully shown). 
<i>Open</i> displays messages which the user has directly opened (or in the case of sent 
messages, not yet closed). 
<i>All</i> displays all messages. 
The search box creates a tab displaying any messages matching the query [not yet implemented]. 
Clicking a message hyperlink anywhere in the UI creates a tab displaying 
only the referenced message (see <a href="#mark">Markdown</a>). 
</p>

<p>To open or close a message, click the message header (contains the date, time, and 
sender's alias). 
While a newly-opened message is loading, <span uk-icon="future"></span> is displayed. 
</p>

<p>Attachments received or sent in messages of the thread are listed in the 
<span uk-icon="location"></span> menu. 
The list may be sorted using the <i>Date</i>, <i>Name</i>, and <i>Size</i> tabs. 
</p>

<p>To view the message that delivered an entry in the <span uk-icon="location"></span> menu, 
click the <span uk-icon="mail"></span> hyperlink for that item.

<p>To open or download a file in the <span uk-icon="location"></span> menu, 
click its filename or <span uk-icon="download"></span> hyperlink. 
To view a form, click its <span uk-icon="triangle-left"></span>formname hyperlink [not yet implemented]. 
</p>


<h4 id="rcpt">10a. Recipients</h4>

<p>Individuals or groups who have received a copy of the thread are listed 
in the <span uk-icon="social"></span> menu. 
Recipients who have unsubscribed from the thread do not receive new messages, and are 
indicated by <span style="text-decoration:line-through">&nbsp;Recipient Name&nbsp;</span>. 
To view the <i>Note</i> for a recipient, mouse over their name in the list. 
The list may be sorted using the <i>Date</i>, <i>Who</i>, and <i>By</i> tabs. 
</p>

<p>To forward a thread to new recipients (or resubscribe unsubscribed recipients), 
open the <span uk-icon="social"></span> menu, 
edit the <i>Note</i> field if desired, 
use the <i>To</i> field to select an alias or group, and press enter to enlist them; 
repeat for other recipients. 
(Recipients won't receive anything unless the thread is forwarded.) 
To remove a recipient from the forward, click the pop-up menu to show all recipients, 
then click the &times; button for the target item. 
Click the <span uk-icon="forward"></span> button to forward the thread. 
</p>

<p>A forwarded thread is delivered without any attachments. 
These are automatically delivered separately by the attachments' original senders. 
This policy prevents the transmission of malware disguised as a benign attachment from a trusted sender. 
A copy of each message is also automatically delivered by its original sender. 
Until the copy is received, the sender's name on the message is labeled <i>[unverified]</i>, 
and the label's hover text gives the identity of the account that forwarded the thread. 
If the original copy does not match the forwarded version, the sender's name is labeled 
<i>[possibly forged]</i>.
</p>


<h4 id="recv">10b. Received/Sent Messages</h4>

<p>Heretofore unopened messages present the sender's alias in bold text in the header.

<h4 id="mark">10d. Markdown</h4>

<p>The message Body is written in Markdown, a widely used plain-text shorthand 
for essential rich-text HTML features. 
Markdown avoids the mouse reliance and inconsistent behavior of browser WYSIWYG editors. 
Consult the <a target="_blank" href="http://commonmark.org/help/">CommonMark Reference</a> 
for a description of its features. 
mnm extends Markdown as follows: 
</p>

<p><b>Images</b> must reference a file in the Attachment list, or one attached to a previous 
message in the current thread. 
This prevents the sender from forcing the recipient's browser to contact an Internet site 
without the recipient's consent. 
</p>

<p>For a file in the Attachment list, write:          <tt>![<i>alt</i>](this_u:<i>file_name</i>)</tt>
<br>For a file attached to a previous message, write: <tt>![<i>alt</i>](<i>file_ref</i>)</tt>
<br>To obtain a <tt>file_ref</tt>, open the <span uk-icon="location"></span> menu, 
click the <span uk-icon="link"></span> hyperlink for the target file, then paste the 
string from the clipboard. 
<tt>alt</tt> is any desired text. 
</p>

<p><b>Blank Forms</b> must reference a form in the Attachment list, or one attached to a previous 
message in the current thread. 
</p>

<p>For a form in the Attachment list, write:          <tt>![?](this_f:<i>form_name</i>)</tt>
<br>For a form attached to a previous message, write: <tt>![?](<i>form_ref</i>)</tt>
<br>To obtain a <tt>form_ref</tt>, open the <span uk-icon="location"></span> menu, 
click the <span uk-icon="link"></span> hyperlink for the target form, then paste the 
string from the clipboard. 
</p>

<p><b>Hyperlinks</b> may reference a remote site, or a file attached to a message 
in the current thread, or a previous message in any thread. 
References to relative URLs are disallowed. 
</p>

<p>For a remote site, write:                          <tt>[<i>text</i>](<i>url</i>)</tt>
<br>For a file in the Attachment list, write:         <tt>[<i>text</i>](this_u:<i>file_name</i>)</tt>
<br>For a file attached to a previous message, write: <tt>[<i>text</i>](<i>file_ref</i>)</tt>
<br>For a previous message in any thread, write:      <tt>[<i>text</i>](<i>msg_ref</i>)</tt>
<br>To obtain a <tt>file_ref</tt>, see Images, above. 
To obtain a <tt>msg_ref</tt>, open the message, click the <span uk-icon="link"></span> hyperlink 
to the right of the header, then paste the string from the clipboard. 
<tt>text</tt> is any desired text. 
</p>
